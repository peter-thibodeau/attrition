# Introduction

# Data Source
The sightings are from the National UFO Reporting Center (NUFORC) which was acquired by Sigmond Axel and can be found at https://github.com/planetsig/ufo-reports. I downloaded it as a .csv file.  

NUFORC allows the use of the data for non-commericial uses. There is a caveat on the website that states: "The National UFO Reporting Center makes no claims as to the validity of the information in any of these reports. Obvious hoaxes have been omitted, however most reports have been posted exactly as received in the authorâ€™s own words." The NUFORC website address is https://nuforc.org/.

# Data Cleaning
Several variable names are unrecognizable by SQL and have to be changed as shown in the following table:

|Variable|New name|
|:---|:---|
|duration (seconds|duration_sec|
|duration (hours/min)|duration_hour_min|
|date posted|date_posted|

- Remove leading and trailing spaces.
- Change strings to upper case to simplify SQL queries.
- Remove duplicate records.
- Remove punctuation marks in city.
- Revove datetime strings that are less that 10 characters in length.
- Extract date from datetime.
- Extract time from datetime.
